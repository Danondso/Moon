## What is this all about?
My name is Dublin Anondson. I'm from Alaska, I'm left-handed, I like playing music and building stuff. I code things and people pay me. 

I thought I'd try blogging or something like that. 

Chronicaling the things I do sounds fun.

Btw shout out to the theme's creator <a href="https://github.com/TaylanTatli" target="_blank">TaylanTatli</a>, it's absolutely gorgeous.
