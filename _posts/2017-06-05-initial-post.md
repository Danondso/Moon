## Indecision

A long time ago I thought to myself it would be fun to write a blog. I figured it would help me better organize my thoughts and improve my communication skills or something like that. I thought about building a website / blog from scratch but goddamn that's some hard shit right there. I don't have any patience for figuring out the nuances of responsive design, especially when there's tons of frameworks out there that
automate most of that.

I find while I'm writing this I feel like I don't have much to talk about. I suppose as I persist with this that will change. I guess I'll have to see.
