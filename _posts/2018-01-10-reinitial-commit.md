I think it's really important to set time aside to work on one's self, so I've decided to try to turn my career into something more lucrative. 
I thought the struggle would be good for me and overall would provide some good built-in character building exercises.

I've started reading **Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual** by the lovely John Sonmez. 
The first chapter of section one talks about changing your mindset from thinking of yourself as a business vs. an employee.
He equates it to a blacksmith setting up shop in a town, you're on the scene providing a service. A service that you offer to whomever you like, backed by a reputation of quality work and a good reputation (ideally anyway).

I thought it was interesting that it never occurred to me before. I mean, it's pretty obvious when 
you think about it (so I say from mostly the realization and not fully putting it into practice). 
You put yourself in this sort of position of power in your own head. 

You start asking yourself questions like:<br>
*How can I provide a more superior service to my client(employer)?*<br>
*What can I do to attract prospective clients?*<br>

I enjoy the notion of the business mindset because I think it's sets you up to think more independently of your employer. 
Not that I'm saying being loyal to your employer is a bad thing, I just think, like an souring relationship, sometimes you just need to end it and move on.

I think it sounds way better than thinking your stuck someplace.

Are you thinking like a business?<br> 
Are you not?<br> 
Thinks it's a bad idea?<br> 
Let me know down below!<br>
