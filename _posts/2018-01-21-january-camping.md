I'm sitting around a campfire in at the beginning of January. It's roughly 23 degrees outside and I can't feel my toes. 
My phone is off in my car, there's no cell service out here.

I'm void of electronics, and I love it. 

Once a year I venture into the woods with a bunch of other people and we sit around a campfire and hike for 2-3 days.
Some people have been coming for years, other have only just started (I'm in my 3rd year now).
I barely know some of the people that show up, but we're all comrades for three days. It's awesome.
We freeze, we hike, we drink, we laugh, fun times.

Being a software developer, I spend hours and hours each week on the computer, at work and home.
And if I'm not, I'm on my phone, reading the news, checking my recommended albums on Google Music or scrolling through
Instagram to see what bands are dropping new albums (and rushing to chrome to pre-order them if I like them enough).

I try to stay cognizant of how often I spend time on my phone. On more than one occasion I catch myself looking at it too often. It's a struggle to not look at it out of boredom some days, it's darn near reflexive for me to pick it up and scroll through something at this point. <br>
But man, for three days out of the year I can't use it, and it feels so good. I'm starting to think I should turn it off 
for a whole day at least once a week.

To get to the larger point here, I think there can be lots of interaction improvements when you're not interacting with your phone so much, especially with people.
My perception of them isn't getting clogged up with memes they share or some dumb opinion rant they throw up regarding the line at Starbucks or the latest, greatest political antics going on.

I get them without knowing all their e-baggage, and I think it's a much better, more genuine way to know someone.<br>

It's funny when you think about it, you can make yourself more mysterious by just not having a Facebook now, it's hilariously easy. 

I deleted my Facebook around three years ago and I haven't looked back since. Granted, I kept my instagram (pictures > opinions errday) and Snapchat (praise the dancing hotdog), but I never find myself missing the news feed.
It's nice, it's quiet. I shouldn't be caring about what someone from highschool did. 

It's not affecting me. There's way cooler ways to interact with people.

Like camping in January, sometimes you miss the modern amenities afforded to you. But, like camping in January, you end up reprioritizing what's really important. 

And it's probably not Facebook.
